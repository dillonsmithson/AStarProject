# A Star implementation
A star algorithm implementation

What works
----------
- A Star algorithm for the player (For the most part)
- A Star Evade for player (kinda)
- Enemy Behavior 1, 2, and 3 all work

Bugs
----
- Sometimes the player will not find a path to the goal tile even though there is a clear path to the tile.
- After coming back out of the evade algorithm, the player freezes in place.
- Enemy 2 and Enemy 3 like to go through walls for some reason.
- The player, after coming out of evade, will start to go through walls before continuing the A star path.
